# Integers in C#
 Summary of Integer in C#
Variable Types and Operations

# Integers and Division
The program declares integer variables (int) and demonstrates basic arithmetic operations.
It highlights the limitation of integers, specifically the fact that they have a maximum value of approximately 2 billion.


# Longs
Introduces long integer variables (long) that can handle larger values than regular integers.

# Doubles
Demonstrates the use of double-precision floating-point variables (double) for handling decimal numbers with greater range and precision than integers.

# Shorts
Discusses the limitation of short integers (short) and comments out a section that would result in a compilation error due to the division of shorts.

# Decimals
Introduces decimal variables (decimal) for high-precision arithmetic.

# Floats
Demonstrates the use of single-precision floating-point variables (float).

# String Manipulation
Defines a string variable (string) and briefly explores the concept of converting a string to an array (commented out).
Uses a loop to iterate through the characters of the string.

# Conditional Statements
Utilizes a boolean variable (bool) and conditional statements (if-else) to control program flow based on a logical condition.

# Loops
For Loop
Demonstrates a for loop that iterates through the characters of a string.

# While Loop
Introduces a while loop that continuously prints a message as long as a specified condition is true.
